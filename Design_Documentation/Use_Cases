USE CASE 2: NEW SESSION PROCESS
Primary Actor(s): Device user
Stakeholder and Interests: 
Device user (consumer, patient) - wants the therapy treatment to help their mental state.
Device manufacturers and designers - want the system to remain in proper working condition over the expected lifespan.

Preconditions: The device user has access to the EEG headset, in addition to the device. The device is powered on.
Success guarantee(s): The device user’s session is completed successfully and recorded.
Main success scenario:
The device screen displays the timer and progress bar.
The user puts on the EEG headset and initiates contact with the electrodes.
The device starts the timer and progress bar once contact is initiated.
The blue light indicator turns on to show contact is initiated.
The device begins the treatment process. Throughout the process, the timer updates to show the approximate time remaining, and the session progress bar keeps the user informed of the percentage of treatment completed.
(Treatment description begins) <- delete this when we’ve figured out the treatment steps
The device calculates a baseline for each EEG site at once (concurrently) over approximately one minute. 
The device determines the average dominant frequency for that site. 
The treatment is applied individually to each EEG site for one second per site (total of approx 21 seconds?), with the green light flashing to indicate treatment delivery. 
(Treatment description ends) <- delete this when we’ve figured out the treatment steps
Once the treatment is complete, a baseline is once again calculated for all 21 EEG sites.
The session information (date, time, baseline average frequency before treatment, baseline average frequency after treatment) is recorded in a new session log on the device.

Extensions: 
*a. The user pauses current session (Use Case 5).
*a. The user stops current session (Use Case 6).
2a.-4a. Contact is lost and is reestablished within 5 minutes
	2a1.-4a1. Once contact is lost, the red light indicator starts flashing.
	2a2.-4a2. The session is paused. The device starts beeping.
	2a3.-4a3. Contact is reestablished before 5 minutes of lost contact. The device stops beeping. 
2a3.-4a3. The session resumes.
2b.-4b. Contact is lost and is not reestablished within 5 minutes.
	2b1.-4b1. Once contact is lost, the red light indicator starts flashing.
